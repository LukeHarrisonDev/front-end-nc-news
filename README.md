# Luke's NC News Full Stack Project

Welcome to my Full Stack project -
https://lukesncnews.netlify.app/

## The Project

The site utilises my own Back End API to access development data. I then created an interactive news website where you can use filters, select topics, login, and post/delete comments.

The API can be found here -
https://nc-news-4-life.onrender.com/api

Or you can view the GitHub Repo -
https://github.com/LukeHarrisonDev/nc-news

## Setup

To view the Repo, follow these instructions in your terminal-

1. git clone https://github.com/LukeHarrisonDev/front-end-nc-news
2. cd front-end-nc-news
3. npm install
4. npm run dev

    [this will run the site locally]

    Follow the link that shows up in your terminal

## Minimum version

Node - v21.7.3
